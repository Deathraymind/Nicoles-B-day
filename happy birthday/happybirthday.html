        <p>Happy 18th Birthday, Nicole. I know that you will love college and the bit more freedom, I know I do.</p>
        <p>It's really annoying going to the doctors, other than that being 18 is great! Hope you enjoy this little site I made.</p>
        <p>I tried drawing but gave up instantly.</p>
